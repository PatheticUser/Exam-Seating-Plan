## 🧑‍💻 **How It Works**
Once the program is running, it will guide you through the following steps:
1. 📋 **Input Students Data**: Enter the number of students and their details.
2. 🪑 **Choose Seating Arrangement**: Select your preferred seating plan:
   - **Random Arrangement**: Seats are assigned randomly.
   - **Linear Arrangement**: Students are seated in the order of their input.
   - **Mixed Arrangement**: A combination of both random and linear seating.
3. 💾 **Save & Edit**: Save the seating plan to a file, or choose to modify it if needed.

### Example Seating Plan:
```plaintext
Row 1: Student A - Seat 1 | Student B - Seat 2 | Student C - Seat 3
Row 2: Student D - Seat 4 | Student E - Seat 5 | Student F - Seat 6
```

## 🎯 **Use Cases**
- 🎓 **Exams**: Organize seating for midterms, finals, or any other tests.
- 🏫 **Class Activities**: Randomize seating for group projects or presentations.
- 🪑 **Seminars/Workshops**: Assign seating to participants based on specific rules.
