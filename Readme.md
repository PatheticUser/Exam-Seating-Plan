## **How It Works**

After launching the program, it walks you through the following:

1. **Input Student Data**  
   Enter the total number of students and their basic details.

2. **Select Seating Arrangement**
   - **Random**: Seats are assigned at random.
   - **Linear**: Students are seated in the order they are entered.
   - **Mixed**: A blend of random and linear assignments.

3. **Save and Edit Options**  
   You can save the seating arrangement to a file and modify it later if necessary.

### Example Seating Output:
```
Row 1: Student A - Seat 1 | Student B - Seat 2 | Student C - Seat 3
Row 2: Student D - Seat 4 | Student E - Seat 5 | Student F - Seat 6
```
